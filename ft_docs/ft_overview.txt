FileTasker
==========

FileTasker is a general-purpouse task-oriented ETL tool, written with modular extensability in mind.


Overview
========

FileTasker is split into modules.
Each module is responsible for implimenting a subset of operations a task can choose to call.

Most automated functions can be stubbed out and/or overridden in a task, or extended by overriding specific strategically placed hooks in existing functions.
This is as simple as declaring a new shell function with the same name as the old function or hook.

Core functionality is kept in ft_common_ops.
This includes helpful shell functions, such as array matching, task loading and validation, subtask selection, and execution of external tools.

The logging, tracing, and narration functionality is kept in ft_logging_core and ft_logging_ops.
In turn, this has it's own submodules: ft_logging_console for narration, ft_logging_files for tracing, and ft_logging_db for metainfo.

File based ETL is handled by the ft_file_core and ft_file_ops modules.
This also has it's own submodules: ft_file_compression, ft_file_matching, ft_file_hashing, and ft_file_signing.
